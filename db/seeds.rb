Review.create(noodle_rating: 3, noodle_comment: "Udon isnâ€™t my favorite noodle but tried to be objective. In the first few minutes, the noodles withstood soaking quite well and remained bouncy. However, towards the end they did start to swell although avoided breaking down did lose some of the original texture.", toppings_rating: 3, toppings_comment: "Standard toppings but with fishcakes, seaweed AND a piece of kombu! Would recommend putting kombu into the pot at the start of the boil, and rest of the toppings closer to the end of the boil to retain more flavor", spice_rating: 1.5, overall_rating: 3, overall_comment: "A well balanced bowl of noodles worthy of challenging Neoguri, with potential to be great with some tweaks.", user_id: naijia.id, noodle_id: ottogi.id)
